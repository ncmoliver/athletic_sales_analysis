# athletic-sales-analysis

## Overview

This analysis focuses on refining and dissecting athletic sales data for a company. The process involved merging dataframes, standardizing and adjusting column names, and filtering large datasets to enhance readability for users. Utilizing the groupby() and pivot_table() functions, several key insights were obtained, including:

- The region with the highest product sales
- The region generating the most revenue
- The retailer with the highest sales volume
- The retailer leading in sales of Women's Athletic Footwear

## Analysis Features

The key main features used to produce this analysis is the use of the groupby() and pivot_table() functions. These two functions made organizing the data into more digestable viewpoints.

## The Process

## Pre-Processing

| Step           | Description         |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| **Step 1** Import required packages:   | Import packages and read in 2020 and 2021 csv files into dataframes using 'pd.read_csv'.     |
| **Step 2** Combining Dataframes:      | Using the concat() function, this made combining the data from two separate csv files (for years 2020 and 2021) together into one dataframe as ease. Axis=0 ensures the two dataframes are connected by rows, **not**  side by side adding additonal columns ‚ùå. This means that the additional data will be listed under the last row, adding additional rows ‚úÖ |
| **Step 3** Convert the date column to datatype üï∞Ô∏è datetime: | The 'invoice_date' columns holds date which can be easily accessed by converting the column to a datetime datatype.    |

### Most Products Offered 'Total Number of Products' - Region, State, City

| -------------------- | ---------- |
| **Step 1** Filter 'total_sales' by region, state, city, and product: | In this step, the goal is to separate the data using the groupby(), applied .sum() to total the sales. Using pivot_table() function, applied the sum function through the aggfunc as a parameter of the pivot_table function ü•µüòÖ. |
| **Step 2** Clean & Sort Data:                           | Once the data is filtered into region, state, and city we can rename the columns for better visibility and sort the data in descending order to locate the top store(s) witht the most sales, listed by region, state, and city.  |

Using pivot_table() function, applied the sum function through the aggfunc as a parameter of the pivot_table function ü•µüòÖ. |
| **Step 2** Clean & Sort Data:                           | Once the data is filtered into region, state, and city we can rename the columns for better visibility and sort the data in descending order to locate the top store(s) witht the most sales, listed by region, state, and city.  |
