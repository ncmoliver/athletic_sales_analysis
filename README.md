| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Step 1** Import required packages:                     | Import packages and read in 2020 and 2021 csv file .                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Step 2** Combining Dataframes:                         | The first step was combining the data from years 2020 and 2021 together into one dataframe, by rows. This means that the additional data will be listed under the previous data instead of side by side. |
| **Step 3** Convert the date column to datatype datetime: | The 'invoice_date' columns holds date which can be easily accessed by converting the column to a datetime datatype.                                                                                      |

| **Step 1** Filter by # of products sold by region, state, city: | In this step, the goal is to separate the data using the groupby() and pivot_table() functions to find the total. The end product should show you the number of product for each region, state, and city. |
| **Step 2** Clean & Sort Data: | Once the data is filtered into region, state, and city we can rename the columns for better visibility and sort the data in descending order to locate the store(s) in a specific region, state, and city that offer the most products on shelf. |
